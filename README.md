#Offspring
This is my Ludum Dare 27 compo entry "Offspring."

## OVERVIEW
Offspring is a game about guiding a planet's evolution to life, humanity, and eventually space travel.

###THEME
10 Seconds is the theme of the competition. I'm using that as the amount of time it takes for one of
your six "children" to fast-forward massive changes in a single location. For example, it only takes
ten seconds to evolve a rodent from simple cells, or 10 seconds to turn a village into a city.

In case 10 seconds turns 

###GOAL
Bring about a space-faring civilization on the planet.

###HOW TO PLAY 
Let you know later.

###JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY REFERENCE
You'll feel better if you have a cookie!
