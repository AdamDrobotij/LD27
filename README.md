#Offspring
This is my Ludum Dare 27 compo entry "Offspring."

## OVERVIEW
Offspring is a game about guiding a planet's evolution to life, humanity, and eventually space travel.

###THEME
10 Seconds is the theme of the competition. I'm using that as the amount of time it takes for one of
your six "children" to fast-forward massive changes in a single location. For example, it only takes
ten seconds to evolve a rodent from simple cells, or 10 seconds to turn a village into a city.

###GOAL
Bring about a space-faring civilization on the planet.

###HOW TO PLAY 
You have control of six children. If you have a free child (they're at the top of the screen)
you can click on a space to send a child to work there. Over a period of 10 seconds (or less
if you had a lower child time selected in the main menu) a large amount of change/evolution/decay
will happen. Then the child will return back to the top, ready for reassignment. Many changes will
happen automatically because critical conditions exist.

The goal is to bring about the creation of a civilization and a space launch.

The game is covered by many rules. Explore. Or cheat, look below for spoilers.

## SPOILERS
Coming up...

Yes I know this game only has a few weak connections to scientific reality.
